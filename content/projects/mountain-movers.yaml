name: Mountain Movers
projectDescription: |
  Being one of my earliest design contributions to the National School Project, this project is still one of my favorites as well as the rest of my team’s favorite. As the first graphic design and media intern for the marketing department of the organization, my team entrusted me with the task of designing our first official department logo. With inspiration from Matthew 17:20, our team wanted to be known as the “Marketing Mountain Movers,” seeking to have the kind of faith that moves mountains through the power of Christ. They also wanted the design to be influenced by Luke 17:5-6, verses about having faith that would cause a mulberry tree to move from the ground into the sea. I incorporated these elements into a design that would host both the mountains and the tree in the sea. With this detail a part of the design, our team is able to be reminded of the type of faith we are seeking to have as we work together on major projects during the year. The team logo is meant to stay as simple and clean as possible in order to create various apparels and products for the entire team to have. The colors of white, red, and black are chosen in order to make the design stand out and easy to read quickly.
