name: Psalm Creatures
projectDescription: |
  The heart of this project was to provide a meaningful way for me to spend time with God while studying the Psalms in a new and enriching way. I have a high fascination and deep devotion for seeking spiritual formation through the arts, allowing art to play a major role in my relationship with God as well as othersâ€™ relationship with Him. For this project, I kept a consistent schedule for 150 days to read a psalm through mediation and prayer. During my reflections of the passage, I would then use a small sketchbook and a pencil to illustrate a creature that is designed to embody the emotions and message behind the psalm. Each creature was created with intentions to reveal the essence of the passage as well as my own spiritual conversation with God. These illustrations have been used in personal and group devotionals in order to provide a unique way to spiritual connection with God as well as others.

  The project is currently presented as hand-drawn sketches in small books as well as a printed deck of cards with every individual Psalm Creature. I hope to further expand the possibilities of this project and explore other unique ways and mediums to share these creatures with hope of aiding others to deepen their faith and understanding of the psalms.
