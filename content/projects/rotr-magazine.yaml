name: Return of the Rings Magazine
projectDescription: |
  Based off of a Lord of the Rings movie magazine from my childhood, the Return of the Rings features a reimagined, fantastical, and clean look. This magazine displays the photo aesthetic of the Middle Earth world while the design creates a simple, yet engaging, feel to the magazine as a whole. Formally a school assignment, this project has helped me understand design layouts for magazines and books and how design has the power to create a better reader experience. I explored various setups and styles for the general layout of the magazine, hoping to achieve a look that best aids the written and visual content presented. The article presented deals with the topic of light and dark within the series. With that in mind, I believe I created a design and aesthetic that best highlights the article.
