name: Vanilla Twilight
projectDescription: >
  An identity project based off of my own character in a fantasy roleplaying game, Vanilla Twilight is an imaginative latte, tea, and potions shop. Set in the world of Dungeons and Dragons, this design highlights the characteristics of a young moon elf witch who dreamed of creating her own café that would host her favorite beverage: Vanilla Lattes. My approach for crafting this café’s logo and brand was to create a whimsical design that best represented the character as well as the world she lived in. After researching the background of Dungeon and Dragons as well as Lord of the Rings, I discovered that the medieval styles from both were directly related to the Celtic art of manuscripts, knots, and swirls. I decided to create a unique swirl design that would best represent the playfulness and magical abilities of the character as well as her imagination and ambition. The colors symbolize the persona of the café: relaxing and calm with a hint of magic in the air, using the blues and purple to reflect the peacefulness of the space while yellow brings out the playful, magical nature of the café. This project gave me the opportunity to visually explore the fantasy game of Dungeons and Dragons, creating a fun and engaging brand within the world my friends and I were crafting and narrating ourselves.
